# target_vhdl
VHDL source code (and Xilinx project files) for [my thesis on Target detection of hyperspectral imagery on FPGAs](https://eprints.ucm.es/id/eprint/62874/)

I initially created this repository to track changes locally, so it may not be as clean as it should be. It still contains all files, licensed under MIT, in case anyone finds them usefull. 

There are three repositories that make up my thesis:

 1. [target_vhdl](https://github.com/martinbarez/target_vhdl) for the VHDL source code (this one)
 2. [target-detection](https://github.com/martinbarez/target-detection) the python simulation and plotting I used
 3. [target_tex](https://github.com/martinbarez/target_tex) the LaTeX files for the thesis (may be private)
